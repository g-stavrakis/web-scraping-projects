# Web Scraping Projects

#### 1. Scrape the stats from NBA players and provide recommendation for player to improve the worst defensive NBA team.

2.	Collect the publicly available data required to answer your chosen question using Python and the web scraping and API tools.
3.	Using Python, pre-process the data you obtained using the tools discussed in class, both for cleaning and feature engineering.
4.	Using Python, produce summary statistics and visualizations of the key features in your dataset relevant to answering the question.

#### 2. Scrape and analyse the offering at Aldi's Job postings

1.	Take the example script, in which we scraped Aldi Head Office position information (position title, department, pay, and work hours). Briefly describe all the issues you can find and what they are caused by.
2.	Rewrite the scraping function in order to overcome the issues you encountered above. Moreover, collect additional information that could be sensible to analysis (e.g., holiday allowances), and describe why you would collect this data in the context of competitive intelligence. Describe issues that arise in collecting the additional data.
3.	Run your revised scraping function to collect information on postings, save the information as a csv file, and upload it here.
4.	For the dataset you use, go through the data pre-processing steps (cleansing, scaling, normalization, imputation). Make sure to explain the individual steps and decisions you are making.
5.	Describe and create any features that may be sensible when analyzing the posting data in the context of competitive intelligence.
6.	Formulate a hypothesis about the data (e.g., about an association between types of jobs and salary), and test this hypothesis.

#### 3. Collect YouTube videosâ€™ transcripts and comments using YouTube API
