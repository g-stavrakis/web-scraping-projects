Also, this information is good to know in order to understand what our competitors give as common perk to potential candidates for each position. The first issue we encounter during the collection of this data was mostly due to differences in the title of the section in job description ('Holiday Allowance'/'Holiday'/'holiday allownance'(typo)). The second issue was that some postings specify the Holiday Allowance is terms of weeks and others in terms on days so we needed to convert that properly.\n",

The first issue we encounter here is that some postings have different sentence structure (ex. Quality Control Assistant & Quality Control Deputy) so we need to include this differences in the if statements. The second issue was that the numbers came with the following punctuation with them so we need to remove them in order to convert them to integers.\n",
